# Things still to add 

## PMT cable length 
Each PMT in an mPMT is expected to have a slight cable length delay. And so the offset per PMT should be a little different on a PMT per PMT basis.

## Laser Ball Position uncertainty 
Can do an easy check for this similar to the ``ball bands`` script 

## Laser Ball Time Spread 
This might just be something identical to the PMT TTS
